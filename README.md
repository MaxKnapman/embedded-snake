# embedded-snake
Snake game for Arduino

Current state:
- simulating using wokwi
- circuit designed
- very early version of code

TODO:
- don't allow 180 turns
- add a border
- make points 3x3 pixels instead of 1x1 because they're tiny
- make and upload circuit diagram

Notes:
- currently planning on using a nano with ssd1306 128x64 OLED
